# Photoshop-QuickPreview
A small script for Adobe Photoshop. Useful for quick previews or thumbnails. Exports a .jpeg copy of a document to desktop in your desired pixel size with correct aspect ratio. Very handy when hooked up to an action.

Can easily be customized to let the user choose path and file name.
